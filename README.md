Powershell-Toolkit V 3.0
First public Version

This tool is created to help supporters do their daily job. I created it based on the LazyWinAdmin Toolkit with kind permission
of Francois-Xavier Cat - http://www.lazywinadmin.com/
I had to make a new GUI and added some stuff we use and removed some stuff I don't use.
A good year later, I changed alot in it. That's the version you see now.

There is an issue with .exe packing in Powershell Studio. The language files are not packed an you have to copy the language folder, e.g. en-EN. Then you have to copy the .exe inside this folder. If you do not do this, some buttons and texts will be blank. I am in contact with Sapien about this issue.

If anyone has ideas, input or wants to help you are very welcome. ATM I programm this all by myself, and I am not even good at
programming. You will see this if you look at the code :-)

I do all the programming with Powershell Studio and it helps me alot with the GUI.
