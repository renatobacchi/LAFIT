Powershell-Toolkit V 3.0
First public Version

This tool is created to help supporters do their daily job. I created it based on the LazyWinAdmin Toolkit with kind permission
of Francois-Xavier Cat - http://www.lazywinadmin.com/
I had to make a new GUI and added some stuff we use and removed some stuff I don't use.
A good year later, I changed alot in it. That's the version you see now.

If anyone has ideas, input or wants to help you are very welcome. ATM I programm this all by myself, and I am not even good at
programming. You will see this if you look at the code :-)

I do all the programming with Powershell Studio and it helps me alot with the GUI.

If anyone need help or has questions just check my blog -> www.renatobacchi.ch
